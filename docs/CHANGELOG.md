**Note**: Ethereum has higher gas fees compared to Solana and BSC. We recommend offering multiple chain options to users.

- Automatic delivery with retry logic
- Secure signature verification
- Multiple event types
- Delivery history tracking
- Easy testing with test endpoint

Webhooks are perfect for:
- Sending confirmation emails
- Updating databases
- Triggering analytics events
- Team notifications

### SDK Improvements

- Better error handling
- More comprehensive examples
- Detailed documentation
- Support for edge cases

The SDK now gracefully handles:
- Network errors
- Invalid endpoints
- Payment failures
- Non-JSON responses

## Migration Guide

### From v1.0.0 to Unreleased

#### Ethereum Integration
If you want to support Ethereum payments, add the following environment variable:

```env
ETHEREUM_WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourEthereumAddress
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://eth.llamarpc.com
```

The multi-chain middleware automatically includes Ethereum in 402 responses.

#### Webhooks
To start using webhooks:

1. Register your webhook endpoint:
```bash
POST /api/webhooks
{
  "url": "https://your-server.com/webhooks",
  "secret": "your_secret",
  "events": ["payment.confirmed"]
}
```

2. Implement webhook handler with signature verification
3. Test with `/api/webhooks/test` endpoint

#### SDK Updates
Update your SDK usage to take advantage of improved error handling:

```javascript
const response = await client.get('/api/endpoint');

if (!response.success) {
  // Better error messages now available
  console.error('Error:', response.error);
  console.error('Status:', response.status);
}
```
