# Cursor Rules for Payless Project

## Git Commit Rules
- **IMPORTANT**: All commit messages should be exactly "." (a single period)
- Never use descriptive commit messages
- Keep git history minimal and clean
- Example: `git commit -m "."`

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Next.js best practices
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

## Project Structure
- API routes in `app/api/`
- Components in `components/`
- Chain logic in `lib/chains/`
- x402 protocol in `lib/x402/`
- Documentation in `docs/`
- SDKs in `sdk/`

## Privacy Rules
- Never include personal usernames in code
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Keep API keys in .env.local (never commit)

## Commit Best Practices
1. Always use: `git commit -m "."`
2. Keep commits atomic
3. Commit frequently
4. Force push when needed: `git push origin master --force`

## Multi-Chain Support
- Support Solana and BSC
- Use chain-agnostic middleware
- Add new chains in `lib/chains/`

## API Integration Rules
- All APIs should have graceful fallbacks
- Mock data when API keys are missing
- Real data when keys are provided
- Document all APIs in `docs/API_CONFIGURATION.md`
